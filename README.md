# SimonRemote - Pebble

This allows one to control many aspects of their Mac from the SimonRemote Pebble app. It requires the [companion application](https://github.com/simonremote/simon-mac) installed on the Mac computer. 

SimonRemote app should work in most scenarios (Wifi, 3G, 4G, etc), however, if the Pebble app (on the phone) is backgrounded, the watch won't update information automatically. That is what the *refresh* button is for in the features list. 

## Setup

1. Ensure that the [Pebble SDK](https://developer.getpebble.com/2/) is installed properly.
2. Download the latest SimonRemote-Pebble source code from from [here](https://github.com/SimonRemote/simon-pebble/releases)
3. cd into directory and run `pebble build`
4. `pebble install`
5. In the configuration page, enter the "Channel" given in the menubar dropdown from the Mac application and click 'Submit'
